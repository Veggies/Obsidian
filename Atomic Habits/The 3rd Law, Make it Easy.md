Make bad habits difficult or inconvenient. Even an incredibly small inconvenience or annoyance will make any habit less desirable. Increase friction.
	An example of this is having to switch over to the macbook. I have to hit the USB switcher button, flip the keyboard switches, and use the other mouse. The main thing is the feeling of the mouse though.
The opposite is true for habits I am working on gaining. Remove friction. Make picking up the habit really easy.
	Anki is really easy to open up and use. But I should have it available on Windows too.
Prime the environment. Make starting the task easy. Leave my book next to the recliner. Leave my journal at my desk with a pen. Have my water ready so I don't have to get up and remove my focus.
Make starting the habit a really small task.
	Open Anki
	Go to KodeKloud
	Open youtube and go to Mischa's(?) channel
	Make the habits seem small and easily accomplishable
