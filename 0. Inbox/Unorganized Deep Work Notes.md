Facebook has many benefits to your social life; why would one abandon it just because it doesn't happen to help the small number of activities that we judged most important? Radical reduction of priorities is not arbitrary, but is instead motivated by an idea that has arisen repeatedly in any numbers of different fields, from client profitability to social equality to prevention of crashes in computer programs.
The Law of the Vital Few
	80% of given effect is due to 20% of the possible causes
		The most important 20% of activities you dedicate time to toward a goal have 80% on the outcome of the goal.
		Arguing that the other 80% of activities is important is null (Depending on the total activities), time spent away from that vital 20% means far less gains towards attaining the goal.
Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
	Divide your time, dedicating some to clearly defined stretches of deep work, and the rest open to everything else.
	This amount of time dedicated to deep work has to at least be one entire day. The time dedicated doesn't equate to a whole day, a literal whole day must be committed to deep work.
Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Working Scheduling
	Everyday you accomplish the task, write an X over that day. This was Seinfeld's way of getting better at writing jokes, to write everyday.
		AKA: The Chain Method
	Transform deep work into a regular, rhythmic habit. Something that is done at or around the same time everyday. Something that becomes so regular, it's habitual.
		Times have to be scheduled. They cannot just be at any time.
Rituals
	Create rituals that adhere to a strict schedule.
		These rituals will make your brain be prepared to go into deep mode thinking. If the deep work is predated by a walk, your brain will start to anticipate this thought mode change and will more prepared to think deeply.
	Rituals should also include how you will work once working, and how you will support your work.
		If you are to be studying, then the house should be quiet. Close the door, remove distractions. Obsidian and the learning material should be open, that's it.
		Support your rituals so they are not easily disturbed: have water, have used the restroom, don't be getting hungry, etc.
4DX
	Discipline 1: Wildly Important
		Set goals that return tangible and substantial benefits
		Focus on ambitious goals
		"Say yes to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing"
	Discipline 2: Lead Measures
		Lag Measures
			The thing you are trying to improve
				Goal: Get more customers
				Goal: Earning AWS SAA
		Lead Measures
			The new behavior that will drive success on the lag measures
				New Behavior: Give out more free samples
				Behavior: Studying AWS
					Much easier to spend more time deeply studying than it is to earn the certification
	Discipline 3: Scoreboard
		Create a physical scoreboard that tracks a lead measure. Not just that the lead measure occurred, but for how many or how long it was achieved.
	Discipline 4: Accountability
		Review your scoreboard. Go over what you can do to improve and why you are doing it in the first place.
Don't take breaks from distraction: Take breaks from focus
Schedule every minute of your day
	At the beginning of everyday, plan your day out. Use 30 minute blocks to block out the day.
		If the schedule changes, adjust. When something takes less or more time than predicted, finish the task, and then go back to the schedule and adjust.
	Analyze the tasks.
		How long would it take in months to train a smart recent college graduated with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
			This question can be used to differentiate between shallow and deep work.
			This question doesn't have to be used. I'm sure I will see things in my schedule that are not very valuable, or are a complete waste of time.
