Identity Policy vs Resource Policy
	Identity
		When controlling multiple different resources across an AWS account
		A preference for managing permissions all in one place, use IAM
		Only using one account, since you are only controlling internal users
	Resource
		Controlling a single resource
		Anonymous or Cross-Account
