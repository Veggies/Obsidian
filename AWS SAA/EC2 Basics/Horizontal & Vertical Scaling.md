- Vertical scaling
	- Increases hardware capacity of instance
		- ex. Moving from t3.xlarge to t3.2xlarge
		- Must be done during agreed downtimes
		- Performance cap is instance size
		- Scaling requires the system to reboot/migrate
- Horizontal scaling
	- Adds more instances
		- Load balancer is used to balance traffic across the instances
	- Off-host sessions
		- Sessions are stored off the host in a database or somewhere else
	- No disruption when scaling since the existing instances aren't being resized
		- If shrinking, still no disruption because of off-host sessions
	- No real limit since you can infinitely add instances
	- Less expensive than vertical
