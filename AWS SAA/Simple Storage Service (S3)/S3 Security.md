- **S3 is private by default**
	- Account which created bucket has access by default. That's it.
- S3 Bucket Policy
	- Type of resource policy, similar to an identity policy but instead attached to a resource
		- Controlling who can access that resource
		- Allow or deny access for anyone, whether it be users within the account, or an entirely different account, can reference any identities
		- Allow or deny anonymous [[IAM Users#^59425d|principals]]
	- Contains a principal section in the policy that defines which principals are effected by the policy
		- A good way to automatically know the policy is a resource policy if it contains the principal section
	- Buckets can only have one policy
- Block public access setting will do just that
