- Regional & Public Service
	- KMS Keys are isolated to the region they are created in, and do not leave.
- Create store and manage keys
	- Symmetric and Asymmetric
- Keys never leave KMS
	- Provides FIPS 140-2 (Level 2)
- KMS Keys
	- Contains ID, date, policy, description and state
	- Backed by physical key material
		- Can be generated or imported
		- Can directly encrypt or decrypt 4kb of data
- Keys are never stored in plain text form on disk
- Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)
	- Generated using KMS keys
		- Linked to the KMS key that created it
	- Works on data > 4KB
	- DEKs is not stored by KMS in anyway. It just provides it to you or the service using KMS, then discards it
		- Provides a plaint text key
		- Provides a cipher text version of the same key
			- Encrypted used the KMS key that generated the DEK
				- This allows for you have an encrypted version of the key that can then be sent to KMS to be decrypted, allowing you to have the decrypted plain text version of the DEK
- AWS owned or Customer Owned
	- AWS keys work in the background and are mostly not interacted with
	- Customer owned
		- AWS Managed
			- Automatically created by AWS when you use a service that integrates with AWS
			- Key rotation cannot be disabled, rotates approx. annually
		- Customer Managed
			- Created explicitly by the customer, more configurable than AWS managed keys
			- Key rotation is optional, enabled by default, approx. annually
	- Keys contains backing key and previous backing key
		- This means that when a rotate occurs, previously encrypted data with the older key can still be decrypted.
- Key policy
	- Resource policy
	- Every key has one
