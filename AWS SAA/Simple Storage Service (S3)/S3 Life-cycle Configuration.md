- Automatically transition or expire objects
- A set of rules
	- Consists of actions
	- Can apply to bucket or groups of objects
- Transition Actions
	- Change storage class, IE standard to standard IA
		- S3 One Zone IA cannot transition to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, but can transition to flexible and deep archive
			- Object must exist on a standard bucket for 30 days before transfer to IA or OneZone IA
			- Applies when transferring from an IA to Glacier if the transition is defined in a single rule
				- If you define Standard>IA in one rule, and IA>Glacier in another, you do not have to wait for the IA>Glacier 30 day minimum
		- Generally you will take one step down at a time, but you can go down directly (IE Standard to Deep Archive)
	- Transitions cannot go upward, only down
- Expiration Actions
	- Can delete objects, object groups, object versions
