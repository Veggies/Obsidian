- KMS key is used to create a time limited bucket key within S3 that can be used to generate DEKs within the bucket
	- This prevent the throttling and cost issue associated with only using KMS
- CloudTrail logs will show the bucket ARN instead of the KMS object when this is enabled
- When an object is replicated it will maintain the original object encryption
- If replicating plain text to a bucket that has bucket keys enabled, the object is encrypted at the destination
