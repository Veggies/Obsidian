- S3 Standard
	- Object is replicated across at least 3 availability in the AWS region
	- When objects have been stored durably, S3 sends a HTTP/1.1 200 status
	- First byte latency
		- Objects uploaded are available within milliseconds
	- Use case
		- S3 standard should be used for frequently accessed data that is important and non-replaceable
	- Costs
		- GB/month fee
		- $/GB for transfer out
		- Price per 1,000 requests
- S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
	 - Replicated across 3 AZs, publicly available, first by latency
	 - About half of the price of S3 Standard
	 - Costs
		 - Per GB data retrieval fee
		 - Minimum duration charge of 30 days, objects can be stored for less but will be charged at minimum 30 days of storage per object
		 - Minimum size charge of 128kb per object
	- Use case
		- Should be used for long-lived data, but is important and access is infrequent
- S3 One Zone IA
	- Retrieval fee, 30 day minimum, 128kb minimum charges
	- Data is only stored in one availability zone, cheaper storage
	- Use case
		- Long lived data, non critical, replaceable, and infrequent access

- # Part 2
- S3 Glacier - Instant
	- Like S3 Standard IA, cheaper storage, more retrieval costs
	- Stored in 3 AZs in the region
	- Costs
		- Per GB retrieval fee
		- Costs increase with frequency of data access
		- Minimum 90 day duration charge
		- 128kb charge per object
	- Use case
		- Long lived data that is accessed ~once a quarter
- S3 Glacier - Flexible (Chilled state data)
	- About 1/6 cost of storage versus standard
	- Replicated across 3 AZs
	- Accessing objects requires a retrieval process
		- When data is retrieved, it is treated as S3 Standard-IA temporarily (Until is no longer be used)
			- Expedited 1-5 minutes
			- Standard 3-5 hours
			- bulk 5-12 hours
			- Faster=More expensive
	- First byte latency of minutes or hours
	- Objects **cannot** be made publicly accessible
	- Cost
		- 40kb minimum billable size
		- 90 day minimum billable duration
	- Use case
		- Archival purpose/data
		- Frequent/real time access isn't needed
- S3 Glacier - Deep Archive (Frozen data)
	- The cheapest storage option
	- Cost
		- 40kb minimum
		- 180 day minimum
	- Objects cannot be publicly accessible
		- Requires a retrieval process
			- Standard 12 hours
			- Bulk 48 hours
			- First byte latency = hours or days
	- Use Case
		- Archival that needs to be rarely or never accessed
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	- 5 Different Storage Tier
		- Frequent Access Like Standard
		- Infrequent Access Like Standard IA
			- Moved after 30 days
		- Archive Instant Access Glacier Instant
			- Moved after 90 days
		- Archive Access Glacier Flex - Optional
			- Moved after 90 - 270 days
		- Deep Archive Glacier Deep Archive - Optional
			- 180 - 730 days
	- Monitors usage of objects to place into appropriate tier
	- Designed for long-lived data with changing or unknown amounts of use
	- Monitoring and automation cost per 1,000 objects, no retrieval charges
