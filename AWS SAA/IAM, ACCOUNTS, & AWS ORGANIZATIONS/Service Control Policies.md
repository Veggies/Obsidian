- Can be used to restrict AWS accounts
- JSON Document
- Can be attached to orgs as a whole by root container or to OU, or even to individual AWS accounts
- SCPs trickle down, meaning if attached to an OU with OUs and Account, all OUs and Account within that OU and itself are effected by the SCP
- Even if a management account has SCPs attached to itself in anyway, the management account is **never** effected
- Limit what the account can do including the account root user
- SCPs do not **grant** any permissions, they just limit what permissions **can** be granted
- Can either create an allow list, or a deny list
	 - Full AWS Access = Deny List, all permissions are allowed to be assigned
