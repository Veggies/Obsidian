- Cloud Trail Event
	- Record of activity in an AWS account
		- Can be an action taken by a user, role or service
	- 90 days stored by *default* in event history, no cost
	- Three different even types, management, data, and inside events
		- Management events
			- Provide information about management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account
			- Also known as Control Plain Operations
				- Examples include creating an EC2 service, terminating an EC2 instance, etc.
		- Data events
			- Contain information about operations performed in or on a resource
				- Ex. Objects being uploaded, or accessed in an S3 bucket
	- By default, only Management events are logged
- To customize a service, you must create a trail
	- A trail can store logs in an S3 bucket indefinitely
		- Stored as JSON log files
	- CloudTrail can send logs to CloudWatch logs
	- Organizational trails can be created from the organization management account to gather logs from the entire organization
- A trail logs events for the AWS REGION it is created in. Regional Service
	- Can be set to one region, or all regions
	- Global services log to us-east-1, for trails to pick these events up they must have global service logging enabled
- CloudTrail is **not** real time logging, there is a delay
