- Control plane
	- Manages the cluster
		- Scaling, deploying, scheduling, etc.
	- kubernetes api used to communicate between kubelet and control plane
		- api can be horizontally scaled
	- etcd
		- highly-available key value database store
	- kube schedulers
		- identifies pods in the cluster with no assigned nodes and then assigns a node
			- based on resource requirements or any number of other specifics
	- cloud-controller-manager
		- provides cloud-specific control logic for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
	- kube-controller-manager
		- node controller
			- monitoring of nodes
		- job controller
		- endpoint controller
		- service account & token controller
- Cluster nodes
		- A VM or physical server which hosts the application in the cluster
	- containerd or docker
		- Software for handling the container within the cluster node
	- kubelet
		- Agent within the cluster node that interacts with the control plane
	- pods
		- smallest unit of computing in kubernetes
		- one-container one pod
			- can contain more than one container if they are required to work closely together
			- non permanent, complete a task and are then removed
	- kube-proxy
		- coordinates networking with the control plane


- Cluster
	- deployment of kubernetes
- Nodes
	- resources, pods on are placed on nodes
- Pod
	- 1 or more containers
	- often 1 container 1 pod
- Job
	- Creates one or more pods until is it complete
- Ingress
	- Exposes a way into a service
- Ingress Controller
	- Provides ingress
- Persistent Volumes
	- Lives beyond the pod's lifecycle
