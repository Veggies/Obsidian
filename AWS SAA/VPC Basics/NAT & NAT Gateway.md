- IP Masquerading
	- Use a single public IP for an entire range of CIDR blocks (Private IPs)
		- Because it is only using one public IP, you cannot request incoming traffic from the internet, only outgoing
	- The VPC will have a route table sending all outgoing connections to the NAT Gateway, remember these IPs cannot receive incoming connections as they are all using the same public IP
		- The traffic will then follow the NAT gateway's route table and be assigned the NAT gateway's IP address
			- Traffic is then sent to the internet gateway, where it's source IP is again changed to the public IP that associate with the NAT gateway
- NAT Gateway
	- Elastic IP (Static IPv4 Public address)
	- AZ resilient
		- For regional resilience, need a gateway in each AZ
			- And one route table for each AZ with a gateway
	- Managed by AWS
	- Billed based on 
		- Number of gateways, billed per hour
		- Data per GB

- # PART 2
- EC2 NAT Instance
	- Must disable source/destination checks
- NAT Gateways cannot use security groups
- NAT Gateways do not work with IPv6
- IPv6 in AWS are all publicly routables
	- ::/0 (All IPv6 ranges) route to IGW will allow bi-directional connectivity
