- AZ Resilient
- One subnet can never be in more than one AZ
- One AZ can have 0 or more subnets
- Subnet CIDR is a subset of the VPC CIDR
	- Cannot overlap with other subnets
- Optional IPv6 CIDR with a /64 subset of the /56 VPC CIDR
- 5 Reserved IP addresses in *every* subnet (Using the example of 10.16.16.0/20)
	- Network address is the very first IP range in the subnet, 10.16.16.0
	- Network +1 is the VPC router 10.16.16.1
	- Network +2 is the Reserved DNS 10.16.16.2
	- Network +3 Reserved future use 10.16.16.3
	- Broadcast address is the last IP in the subnet, 10.16.31.255
- Every VPC has a DHCP Options set, flows through to subnet
	- DHCP Option sets can be changed or swapped out, but cannot be directly edited once created
- On every subnet
	- Auto assign public IPv4 option
