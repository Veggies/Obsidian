[[Atomic Habits]]
The work that hurts you less than it hurts other is the work you're made to do

Finding habits I am suited for:
What makes me lose track of time?
Where do I excel more than others?
What is natural to me?

Win by being different. My unique skillset combo seems to be Creative/Artistic + IT 

Stepping up when you don't feel like doing something separates professional from amateur

Take action even when the mood isn't right

Annual Review, maybe performance this monthly, bi monthly, bi-annual, then annual
What went well
What didn't go well
What did I learn

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
