1.Please state your first and last name and where you are currently located.

2.Can you give us a quick overview of your background?

- Been sitting at a computer desk since I was about 10.
- 6 years in the Air Force, about half of it doing some IT work.
	- Worked in an equipment room where I placed myself in charge of the computer network, responsible for all workstations in their entirety and the network itself
	- Moved to Debriefing, tracking aircraft issues.
		- Responsible for correcting issues, providing historical data, providing end user support for the proprietary system that tracks aircraft information

3.What makes you a great fit for this role?

- After 6 years in the Air Force I'm ready to leave the DoD space. I want to pursue something fun and this looks like something that would be just that: fun.
- IT Operations Engineer Skillbridge
- I have the innate ability to figure anything out. I've really never touched macOS before my current role but within 3 weeks I had become the subject matter expert for the mobile device management system that was implemented (Jamf)
- I am looking to grow my IT career and learn anything at all, large or small.
- I want to have a chance to work in the entertainment industry.
- I want to make things better and am always thinking about ideas.

4.What’s one professional achievement you’re really proud of, and why?

- I'm incredibly proud of a process I created involving application installations. The mobile device management tool we use at my currently role allowed for custom branding to include it's icon and name, so I created a really elegant looking icon with the mascot and renamed the app to "Unicorn App Manager"
	- I created a  repeatable process of providing applications that weren't natively supported through the MDM.
	- This tool is now referenced in numerous professional documents for the company's System Security Plan, Internal Documentation on how to install applications, is the only way approved way to install applications, and will stay there for the rest of the company's life. I created a legacy through this project and am really proud of it.

5.Tell us about a time you had to quickly learn something new on the job.

- macOS and Jamf. I have rarely ever used macOS, but managing it was something that was completely new to me. Jamf was how devices were loaded with configuration profiles, settings, applications, etc. I was assigned to develop a patch management process about 2 weeks into the job.
- Patch management was a nightmare through Jamf's native method. It didn't support all the apps we had deployed, it's notification for updates available was easily missed/suppressed by focus settings, and also lacked a lot of configuration. So I had to research other methods.
- I came across a tool called App-Auto-Patch that utilized another tool called Installomator that addressed these issues.
- I had to then figure out how to deploy App-Auto-Patch to the entire fleet. So I had to read through their git hub documentation on how the whole thing worked, and later created a you tube video on the process because I found their documentation a little bit lacking and confusing.
- I used virtual machines to conduct the testing, and after that was satisfactory I rolled it out to the IT team to see if they could poke any holes in it, which they did.
- I had to figure out why certain apps were being detected as installed even if they weren't. This was because I had missed a setting that ignore apps in the /home/* folder.
- After that fix everything worked as expected. I completed this task in 3 days.

6.What’s your preferred work environment, and how do you collaborate best with others?

- An environment where opportunities to learn are almost always available and cross-departmental work is highly available. I collaborate best with others when there's a method of open communication. Slack, Microsoft teams, zoom, etc. I really like to be able to sit down and just chat and grow interpersonal relationships with those I work with.

7.What’s a challenging situation you faced at work, and how did you handle it?

- I accidentally deployed our patch management system incorrectly once. It made the updater window pop up about 20+ times on some devices making working close to impossible for the few effected. I had to take accountability for the situation (I was leading patch management) by publicly apologizing to all effected, take in all the tickets for the submitted issue, turn off patch management, and troubleshoot it.
	- I worked through the issue by scanning through the configuration settings. I asked questions like, did I change anything? Did I have a situation that would have caused me to change anything?
		- The question, did anything cause me to change anything, reminded me that a user had an issue where an app they did not have installed was being forcefully installed. This caused me to turn off deferral workflow for the patch management process. Turning this back on corrected the issue of the window popping up more than desired.

8.How do you prioritize your workload when you have multiple deadlines?

- Currently I use a kanban board. I organzied my tasks in Not Started, Icebox, In-Progress, In Review, and completed. I prioritize tasks based on their difficulty. If I get stuck on a task that has a later deadline but another task's deadline is approaching, I'll halt work on the difficult task and switch over to the task that is coming due. The kanban board is incredibly effect for me, I have yet to need to request any sort of extension for any tasks assigned.

9.What excites you about this opportunity and our company?

- To be able to break into the entertainment industry and see what it's all like and to be able to form connections and contribute to something where the goal is to create something enjoyable for others is something I can connect with. I've been stuck having to "complete the mission" of the Air Force. I'm ready to do something else. I want to help make other people happy and being a part of AEW would allow me to do so. I want to be part of this company that wants to make entertainment for the people!

10.If you were to join us, what would you want your first 90 days to look like?

- I would start by learning the systems used. This doesn't take me very long as mentioned previously. This would probably take me less time than learning macOS since I've used Windows for so long, but I would probably use the first month to learn the systems.
	- As I'm learning the systems used, I'll be taking note of anything that causes concern or could use improvement, and populating tasks for those into my kanban board. I'll also be writing notes for any of the processes.
		- If we do not have a best practices or outlines of processes documented, I would start to create these in an internally available document.
		- I'll also be attempting to knock out any of the tasks I create if they are that easily correctable/addressable
- In month two I would presumably have tasks begin flowing down to me, or at least I would I expect to have some.
	- I would be working on these tasks
	- Brainstorming ideas of my own. Rarely am I idle at work, I like to stay busy.
	- I would begin to branch out to look at other departments. What are they working on and is there anyway the team I am on could contribute or improve a process they are using? Cross collaboration
- Month three would be presentations of larger ideas I have generated.
	- Generating discussion and feedback for the ideas
	- Creating a workflow/concept map for the projects
	- Proposing the project and potentially looping back if more is required
	- This would become a never ending cycle of generating ideas myself and receiving tasks from above.
